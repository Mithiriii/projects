# Animelist scrypts 
The link to the xml file with your list is here: https://myanimelist.net/panel.php?go=export <br>
You place the xml file in the same folder as the scripts <br>
The minus_one script reduces the rating of all anime by one. Written mainly for my own needs, but maybe someone else will find it useful :P <br>
The change_score_all_anime script displays anime one by one from your list and asks for a rating, which you can change at will. <br>
Scripts require python to support: https://www.python.org/downloads/ <br>

Once the script is finished the editing_list.xml file will be created You upload it here: https://myanimelist.net/import.php <br>
